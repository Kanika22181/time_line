Two key rail lines, the Bengal Assam Railway and North Western Railway, were divided, leaving sections disconnected from India’s rail system. Amid the chaos of partition, violent mobs targeted railway infrastructure and attacked refugee trains, causing widespread destruction." },

By 1951-1952, the network was reorganized into zones to improve management and efficiency. In 1976, the first train service between India and Pakistan, the Samjhauta Express, began operations, connecting Amritsar and Lahore." },
                { image: "im_3.jpg", description: "In the second half of the 20th century, Indian Railways took significant steps toward modernization. Aging colonial-era locomotives were replaced with state-of-the-art trains, while the adoption of 25 kV AC traction in the 1950s marked the beginning of a new phase of electrification. On March 3, 1969, the Rajdhani Express, India's premier long-distance train service, commenced operations with its inaugural journey from New Delhi Railway Station to Howrah Railway Station." },
                { image: "im_4.png", description: "During the 1980s, steam locomotives were completely phased out, driven by the push for electrification following the energy crises of the 1970s. Between 1980 and 1990, approximately 4,500 km of track was electrified. Additionally, India’s first metro system began operations in Calcutta in 1984, marking a significant milestone in urban transportation." },
                { image: "im_5.jpg", description: "While economic stagnation and political instability hindered railway expansion in the 1980s, the 1990s witnessed a major breakthrough with the launch of the Konkan Railway, 738 km corridor linking India’s western coast to the rest of the country." }
